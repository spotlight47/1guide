# 1guide
editable resource guide


1GUIDE is a list creation program  that generates learning paths, instructions, and recipes. It is inspired by Delecious, which was a bookmark sharing tool created in 2003 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)  1 guide will allow ordering of links  and the creation of static text lists  a bookmark isn't only a single path to an end-point, but a path to a list.  1 guide will incorporate node.js as the language because of ubiquity on the web, and for speed / performance issues.  This project will also be a case study for rapid application development processes.  Robert Lazo - July 9, 2020
